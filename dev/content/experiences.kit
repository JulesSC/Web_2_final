        <h4>EXPERIENCES</h4>
        <p>The tented Pavilions of Camp Sarika enable intimate encounters with the wonder of the wilderness, and no compromise on comfort. Framing the surrounding dunes the Suites and the Home embrace the area's raw aesthetic. Surrounded by 600 acres of undeveloped land, the four-bedroom Mesa Home offers consummate privacy just minutes from the resort.</p>
        <p id="bottom">Amangiri is within easy reach of some of North Americaâ€™s most magnificent protected areas, including the Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon, Zion National Park and Monument Valley Tribal Park, home of the Navajo Nation. Occupying 243 hectares Amangiri is as much a gateway to adrenaline-fuelled outdoor adventure as it is to the rich cultural heritage of the Navajo.</p>
